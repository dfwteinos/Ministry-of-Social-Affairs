For this project, the main idea was to recreate the website of the [Goverment of Job and Social Affairs](https://ypergasias.gov.gr/) (which now may is updated).

# Technologies & Frameworks:

For this big project, we used the [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). So, we had:

1. Apache Server
2. MySQL Database

As we have in the description of this repository, we used the follow technologies:

1. PHP
2. CSS
3. HTML
4. Javascript Frameworks
5. Bootstrap 5

In this fully functional website, we have several utilities, such as:

*   **Login & SignUp**
*   **Edit & Update Profile**
*   **Information pages about several topics**
*   **Forms about job's statements**

*Disclaimer* : Not all buttons are functional, such as the buttons for the languages and also the disability one.
